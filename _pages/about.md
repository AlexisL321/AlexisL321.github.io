I am a fourth-year undergraduate at UW-Madison. My research interest is in
**computer graphics** and **computational mathematics**. I am especially interested in physics-based simulation, topology optimization, sparse matrix
algorithms and all kinds of numerical methods and matrix factorization
techniques. I am also constantly exploring new topics within computer graphics!

I have done several [research](https://AlexisL321.github.io/research/) spanning from material science to fluid dynamics to computer vision before finding my passion in computer graphics and computational math. See my [research
page](https://AlexisL321.github.io/research/) for more details!

I am currently looking to apply for grad school and also looking for an
internship in spring and summer 2025.

Feel free to email me at liu2256 [at] wisc [dot] edu.

## Side note

I am a huge history fan. Check out the
[History](https://AlexisL321.github.io/history/) page (currently under
construction) on my website!
