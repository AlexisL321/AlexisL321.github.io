I am a fourth-year undergraduate at UW-Madison, aspiring to pursue my
 interests in
 **computer graphics** and **computational mathematics**. I am especially
 interested in physics-based simulation, numerical linear algebra
 (e.g. sparse matrix factorization/reordering), topology optimization, and numerical analysis. I am also constantly exploring new
 topics within graphics and computational math!

I have done several [research](https://AlexisL321.github.io/research/)
spanning from material science to fluid dynamics to computer vision before
finally finding my passion in computer graphics and computational math. See my [research
 page](https://AlexisL321.github.io/research/) for more details (page still under construction)!

I am currently applying for grad school for fall 2025 and also potentially an
 internship in spring and summer 2025.

My email address is liu2256 [at] wisc [dot] edu.

## Side note

I am a huge history fan. Check out the
[History](https://AlexisL321.github.io/history/) page (under
construction) on my website!
